A plugin that adds your custom notes to the left panel (ribbon) for quicker access both on desktop and mobile

# How to install
1. Download the files in this repository to your computer
2. Find your vault folder, and go to `.obsidian/plugins`
3. You can create a `ribbon-icon-notes` folder here
4. Open the `ribbon-icon-notes` folder, and paste the files into it
5. Now when you go to Settings -> Community plugins, you'll see "Ribbon icon notes" plugin, which you can enable

If enough people are interested in this - I'm happy to publish it officially, since it takes a bit more work to do that and jump through all the hoops there, but for now I thought it would be great to see if people care about this at all, and if you have the interest to use it for a bit - maybe you find some bug I missed! :D
Happy Obsidianing!

# Why
Before I had a file that had 3 notes I would access most of the time, and it was a bit annoying to open it first, and then to go to the note I wanted (especially on mobile), so I decided to make it 1 click instead  

# Plugin settings
After you turn on the plugin, go to the settings. Everything is shown on the screenshot below and there's a step by step walkthrough under it

1. Click on Community Plugins -> Ribbon icon notes
2. This is the name of your icon (when you hover on desktop, or in the menu on mobile)
3. This is the icon of your note (Obsidian provides a set list of icons you can use. [This image](https://forum.obsidian.md/uploads/default/original/3X/8/b/8be3c937905f08c5e0c532228d904e6cb425ab58.png) has **some** of the icons, but I advice you to try them and reload the plugin to find the one you like)
4. This is the path to your note (If you have a note in a path "Folder 1/Folder 2/Cool", then the path to your note will be the same +.md in the end, since markdown is the note's extension. So your full path would be "Folder 1/Folder 2/Cool.md". But you can also link it to files if you want, so not only .md extension)
5. Once you did the previous step 1-3 times, depending on how many icons you want - **reload the plugin to reload the icons**. (Sadly, I couldn't find a more dynamic way to do it now)

**Note: careful when setting paths to notes, it will not give you any feedback if the path is wrong, until you reload the plugin**

I'm aware of the 2 issues above and I would love to solve them, but I'm not sure so far how to do it, and if it's possible at all  

These are how my icons look like now

Otherwise - hope you enjoy and I shave off precious minutes and hours of your life with less clicks :D
